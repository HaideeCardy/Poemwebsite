    <h1>Haidee's Journey into Tech</h1>
<p>
There was once a girl called Haidee,<br>
her brain was feeling quite lazy,<br>
so she began to code,<br>
kick-started learning mode,<br>
and now she's using it daily!<br>
    </p>
<p>
She started with html,<br>
and believed it was going quite swell,<br>
css was next,<br>
to pretty the text,<br>
and she dabbled with javascript as well!<br>
    </p>
<p>
Then there was an intro to GitHub,<br>
to make her a part of 'the club',<br>
a new concept to master,<br>
hoping it's not a disaster,<br>
but if it is there is always the pub!<br>
    </p>
<p>
Now she's on branch number 3,<br>
with no mention of a tree,<br>
running out of ideas to edit,<br>
but at least she's starting to get it,<br>
praying this is all there need be!
