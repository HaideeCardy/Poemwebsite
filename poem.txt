Haidee's Journey into Tech

There was once a girl called Haidee,
her brain was feeling quite lazy,
so she began to code,
kick-started learning mode,
and now she's using it daily!

She started with html,
and believed it was going quite swell,
css was next,
to pretty the text,
and she dabbled with javascript as well!

Then there was an intro to GitHub,
to make her a part of 'the club',
a new concept to master,
hoping it's not a disaster,
but if it is there is always the pub!

Now she's on branch number 3,
with no mention of a tree,
running out of ideas to edit,
but at least she's starting to get it,
praying this is all there need be!
